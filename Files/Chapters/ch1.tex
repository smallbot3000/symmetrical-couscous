As Gregory Maxwell awoke from his alarm, he could feel the tingling sensation leave his limbs as probes left their magnetic anchor points on his shoulders and ankles.
The man’s rather defined arms propped him up as he tried to wake himself up.
Moving his legs to the side of the bed, he rubbed his eyes in an attempt to get rid of the yellow rheum that had seemed to build up in them throughout the night.

After he finished, his eyes were blinded for a few moments as monochrome green light was sprayed across his face from the monitor that sat on the bed’s night stand.
Long gone where the days of colorful displays, especially crafted icons, and graphical interfaces in any form of the word.
They had simply become unnecessary as it had been found that humans slowed down the processes of almost all software, and therefore they were removed from the equation in most cases.
Given that the system that sat on Greg’s side was practically ubiquitous among the people around him it simply printed text to the screen, reading:
\begin{center}
\verb|DREAM DATA UPLOADING|\\
\verb|CREDIT GAIN= 0.02%|\\
\verb|AVAILABLE CREDITS= 65.62%|
\end{center}
The man yawned, his throat dry from the lack of moisture in the room.
It decreased the efficiency of the software that gathered data on his dreams and fed him advertisements in the interim periods between REM cycles.
Gregory stood, his joints popping softly- an old side effect of the nano gel injections they used to preserve cartilage during longer sleep cycles.
The floor beneath his bare feet adjusted the temperature automatically, deciding he was $.02$ degrees cooler than normal.
Rolling his eyes, he ignored it.

Looking through the floor to the ceiling window at the foot of his bed, he could see that the rain from when he went to sleep
had not left him, still shooting down the long windows, collecting somewhere in the ground streets, far from what he could see at his present vantage point.
The room was minimal and angular, all sharp edges and cold metal.
Sleek panels decorated the edges of the floor, shifting colors throughout the day, and the bed, low to the ground, looked far more like an abstract exhibit than anything made for sleeping in.
Pale blue light filtered in through the window, casting watery reflections that danced across the smooth floor.

Gregory’s visual exploration of the room abruptly ended as with another flash of light, the monitor cleared all previous information but the top line.
\begin{center}
\verb|DREAM DATA UPLOAD COMPLETE|
\end{center}
After the standard four seconds passed, the screen cleared once more, shutting off after the screen was completely cleared.
As the system shut off, the room’s door in front of him was unlocked with an electronic click.
It had been determined that many people where not interested in allowing the dream data to completely upload if they did
not have an incentive to do so, so the powers that be decided the best  incentive was to simply lock their citizens in their bedrooms until all the data was sent to the cloud network.

he gathered data was taken and compiled for two broad reasons: the health of the individual, and to keep tabs on the thoughts and possible motives of the individual.
In terms of the health of the individual, the dream data tracked the oxygen levels and respiration rate to ensure proper rest, as well as muscular relaxation.
